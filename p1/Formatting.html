	<h1>Space exploration</h1>
<p><b>Space exploration</b> is the use of astronomy and space technology to explore outer space.While the
<br>exploration of space is currently carried out mainly by astronomers with telescopes, its physical exploration is
<br>conducted both by uncrewed robotic space probes and human spaceflight. Space exploration, <small>like its classical</small>
<br><small>form astronomy</small>, is one of the main sources for space science.</p>

<p>While the observation of objects in space, <mark>known as astronomy</mark>, predates reliable recorded history, it was the
<br>development of large and relatively efficient rockets during the mid-twentieth century that allowed physical
<br>space exploration to become a reality.The world's first large-scale experimental rocket program was <del>Opel</del>
<br><del>RAK</del> under the leadership of <small>Fritz Opel</small> and Max Valier durning <i>the late 1920s leading</i> to the first manned
<br>rocket <ins>cars and rocket planes</ins>, which paved the way for the Nazi era V2 program and US and Soviet activities
<br>from 1950 onwards.</p>
